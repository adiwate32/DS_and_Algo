/**
 Given two integer arrays A and B of size N each which represent values and weights associated with N items respectively.
 Also given an integer C which represents knapsack capacity.
 Find out the maximum value subset of A such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to C.
 NOTE:
 You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item, or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).

 Problem Constraints
 1 <= N <= 103
 1 <= C <= 103
 1 <= A[i], B[i] <= 103

 Input Format
 First argument is an integer array A of size N denoting the values on N items.
 Second argument is an integer array B of size N denoting the weights on N items.
 Third argument is an integer C denoting the knapsack capacity.

 Output Format
 Return a single integer denoting the maximum value subset of A such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to C.

 Example Input
 Input 1:
 A = [60, 100, 120]
 B = [10, 20, 30]
 C = 50
 Input 2:
 A = [10, 20, 30, 40]
 B = [12, 13, 15, 19]
 C = 10

 Example Output
 Output 1:
 220
 Output 2:
 0

 Example Explanation
 Explanation 1:
 Taking items with weight 20 and 30 will give us the maximum value i.e 100 + 120 = 220
 Explanation 2:
 Knapsack capacity is 10 but each item has weight greater than 10 so no items can be considered in the knapsack therefore answer is 0.
